# GenReg
Implementation of paper "GenReg: Deep Generative Method for Fast Point Cloud Registration" [[1]](#1)

This implementation is not the official code, it is community code for a university project.

## Proposed code of conduct
If you are working on one of the ToDos add your name behind it and create a branch with the same or similar name to the todo. When you finished 
the task create a merge request and write in the telegram chat so that a team member reviews your code and completes the merge asap.
Feel free to add missing ToDos.

Also it would make sense to stay close to the coding style used in the exercises of the lecture. This way the code will look uniform and tidy.

## ToDos
### Basic Implementation
- create main notebook/file that downloads data and runs most simple configuration
- complete dataloader
- basic data preprocessing (see section 4.1 of paper)
- implement PointMixer
- implement Feature Interaction module
- implement decoder
- implement PDSAC
- implement discriminator neural network
- complete training file
- add visualization
- run basic implementation successfully
### Experiments
- first add sub ToDos
- 4.3
- 4.4
- 4.5
- 4.6
